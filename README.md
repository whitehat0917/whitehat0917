As I am a senior blockchain and web developer, I have gained over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, system architect, project manager. My primary languages are Solidity, Rust, PHP, Javascript, Typescript, and Python. I'm familiar with most of the leading web frameworks, both on front-end and back-end. In the past, I have been a self-managing, single member on a team, worked with other leaders, and have been a leader of teams up to 5 developers. The teams I've worked with have been both local and overseas, and I know what it takes to successfully deliver a software project in time and on budget.I have worked extensively deploying projects on cloud-based platforms such as AWS, Azure, Linode, and others. Many of my clients have been large e-commerce stores, as well as smaller businesses, independent marketers and more. I've done safety apps, notification apps having to do with GPS tracking of delivery vehicles, and sending customer alerts. My infrastructure knowledge makes me valuable because I can not only write the application but also give advice on successfully deploying it and scaling to an infinite number of users.Also, unlike a lot of developers, I'm friendly, empathetic, and actually want to understand your overall business strategy for the project. The more we communicate, the better job I can do for you as a customer.
